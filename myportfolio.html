        <h3>MY Experience</h3>
        <p>During my web development internship at Dinar Ventures, I had the opportunity to learn a lot in a short time. Their structured guidance helped me understand the basics of front-end development, from building web pages using HTML, CSS, 
           and JavaScript to actually hosting my own website using GitHub Pages. Each day, I was given tasks that pushed me to try new things and improve my coding skills. The experience helped me become more confident in working with code and
           solving problems on my own. I'm really thankful to the team at Dinar Ventures for their support and for giving me this great learning experience.</p>
